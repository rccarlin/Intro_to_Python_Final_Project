# Intro to Python Final Project
Note: this code was originally written in Fall 2021 semester, and this README is a modified version of my submitted project description.

## Goals
• Utilize arithmetic operators
• Utilize list techniques
• Utilize conditional statements
• Utilize file I/O to read files
• Utilize objects
• Utilize dictionaries
• Utilize loops to repeat certain code blocks
• Utilize functions to streamline logic and code
• Produce graphs in Python
• Perform Google searches in Python

## Overall Description
• A dichotomous key is a tool for identifying organisms based on visual characteristics
like coloration, shape, and size. The user will have an [unnamed] organism in mind 
and the key will ask questions to try to guess the identity of said organism. 
Unfortunately, a dichotomous key requires a fixed pool of potential organisms to begin 
with. However, we can at least narrow down an arbitrary set of organisms by filtering 
them based on their characteristics (similar to how one filters products while online 
shopping). Like with online shopping, if the user already knows what they are looking 
for they should be allowed to search the name of the organism (bypassing the filtering 
stage).
• But sometimes the user is less concerned about a specific organism and more 
interested in a set of organisms. Graphs provide a helpful visual summary of the data; 
when used in the context of studying organisms, graphs can depict the distribution 
and/or popularity of certain characteristics.
• This program will not only allow the user to search and filter from a file of snakes (the 
organism of choice when coding in python), but will also create graphs for traits like 
length, color, venomousness for both the entire set of snakes and for the filtered
