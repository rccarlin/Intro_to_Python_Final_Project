Howdy!

To run my project, make sure you have installed (e.g., pip install google in terminal):
1. matplotlib
2. Colour
3. beautifulsoup4
4. google

The first two are for the graphs and the second two are for the search function.

There are four tests (with their expected outputs) written in the Sample Output section of the Project Description.
I tried to make sure every feature was tested at least twice; if four tests are too much, I suggest the second and
third test since they test the most.

Notes to the user (i.e., things written in Sample Output but are not inputs or outputs) are denoted by *** and italics!
